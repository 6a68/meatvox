{"name":"Meatvox","tagline":"bookmarklet to speak the entries added to chat.meatspac.es","body":"## MEATVOX: Text-to-speech for https://chat.meatspac.es\r\n\r\nNote: due to laziness I'm serving the bookmarklet off an S3 bucket: **meatvox.s3.amazonaws.com**.\r\n\r\n### Instructions:\r\n\r\n1. create a bookmarklet with the following contents:\r\n```\r\njavascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://meatvox.s3.amazonaws.com/meatvox.js';})();\r\n```\r\n2. load chat.meatspac.es\r\n3. when the page settles, click your button and behold roboty delight.\r\n\r\n### Etc.\r\n\r\n#### Wat:\r\n\r\nThis is a straightforward application of @kripken's [speak.js](https://github.com/kripken/speak.js), which is an emscripten port of a C++ TTS library to JS. The underlying TTS library is [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/).\r\n\r\n#### About hosting:\r\n\r\nThe code is just a few static JS files, so S3 seemed like the simplest possible solution. I could setup a server with a proper SSL cert and all that, but laziness is next to godliness--it's the cardinal virtue of a good programmer (IMO).\r\n\r\n#### License?\r\n\r\nMy code is Apache 2. eVoice portions are GPL'd.\r\n\r\n#### Release process\r\n\r\n* JS files updated? Manually upload to S3 + re-enable permissions so that 'Everybody' can view the file.\r\n\r\n* README updated? Manually regenerate the gh-pages to pick up changes.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
