The underlying TTS library is [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/).\r\n\r\nAbout hosting: the code is just a few static JS files, so S3 seemed like the simplest possible solution. I made use of [this blog post](http://shlomoswidler.com/2009/08/amazon-s3-gotcha-using-virtual-host.html) to get going.\r\n\r\nPRs welcome. My code is Apache 2. eVoice portions are GPL'd.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
